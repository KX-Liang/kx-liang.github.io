### <img src="/biography.jpg" width="18px">  Biography

Kaixian Liang graduated from Guangzhou University with a bachelors degree of mechanical engineering with outstanding performance (rank 1/168, GPA 3.97/5.0) in July 2021, and is now continuing his studies as a graduate student in mechanical engineering at Guangzhou University (Supervisor: Prof. Zhu Dachang).

I have a deeply interested in Topology optimization, Parallel mechanism, Soft robot and its sensing, and Machine learning. Until now, I have published some research paper in professional journals such as <b><i>Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering</i></b> and <b><i>Mechanism and Machine Theory</i></b>.
